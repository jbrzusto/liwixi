# This script fragment sets up /dev/loop0 on the image file
# /dev/mmcblk0p1/@@LIWIXI_IMAGE_FILENAME@@, so the kernel can use the
# image as its root filesystem.  This script will become part of the
# initramfs's init script, run after the kernel boots but before it
# mounts its rootfs.  The image is also mounted on /dev/sdcard,
# which survives the switchover to the root filesystem.
#
# /dev/mmcblk0p1 can be an SD card with a single, vfat-formatted
# partition (the whole point of liwixi).
#
# See the accompanying script 'pliwixi' for how to build an archive
# containing an appropriate image from a running system.
