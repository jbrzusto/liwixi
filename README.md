# liwixi - linux where I can see it

Boot a Raspberry Pi (and others?) from a Î¼SD card without imaging it.

## For Users ##

- insert a brand new SD card into your laptop

**or**

- format a used SD card as VFAT using your laptop's OS or with one of the tools from

    https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html

- download the liwixi archive from your trusted source e.g. COOLSTUFF_LIWIXI.ZIP

- unzip COOLSTUFF_LIWIXI.ZIP to the SD card

- delete COOLSTUFF_LIWIXI.ZIP - it's *not* needed on the SD card

- safely remove the SD card

- boot the Raspberry Pi with the SD card and...

### Marvel at the Splendour! ###

 - the SD card still has the right size, because instead of a hidden
   linux partition, there is a big fat file called
   COOLSTUFF_LIWIXI_IMAGE_DO_NOT_DELETE right *where you can see it*

 - if you want your SD card back to normal, just delete the files you
   extracted from the LIWIXI archive

 - you didn't have to download, install, and learn to use `Win32DiskImager` or
   `dd` or ...

 - the extra space on your SD card is available, and you can write files to it
   from your laptop, or from the running pi (in /boot).

 - you didn't have to wait for some silly program to write zeroes to the 50% or more
   of your SD card that is still available.

 - the same LIWIXI archive could have been unpacked onto any SD card of sufficient
   size, and no parititon resizing is required.

 - you can have multiple kernels and versions of linux on the same SD card; select
   which one is booted by editing config.txt to change these lines:
   ```
   kernel=kernel7.img
   initramfs=COOLSTUFF_LIWIXI_RAMFS_DO_NOT_DELETE
   ```
   to others

 - if COOLSTUFF needs extra storage for a linux-style filesystem, it will create
   further big fat files called COOLSTUFF_LIWIXI_STORAGE_N_DO_NOT_DELETE where
   N will be a number like 1, 2, ...

## For Developers ##

Linux can use a loopback device for its root file system; you just
have to make sure an appropriate initramfs script takes care of
setting it up before the kernel needs it.

When this image boots, the entire SD card is mounted as a VFAT
filesystem at /boot.  The linux image file is then recursively
accessible as /boot/BRAND_LIWIXI_IMAGE_DO_NOT_DELETE.  The small
initramfs used to set-up /dev/loop0 is then
/boot/BRAND_LIWIXI_INITRAMFS_DO_NOT_DELETE

The image created includes an additional 25% of free space within the
ext4 filesystem, to support the growth of logfiles, etc.  You can of
course allocate further VFAT-file-backed loopback filesystems on the
SD card if you need more storage, but do you really need the features
of a linux filesystem enough to justify hiding the files from your
users?

None of this is original or clever, but it might lower the barrier for
people just starting in small computer linux, and ease the tedium for
developers creating images for them.

### Requirements ###

- a Raspberry Pi (or ???) running a recent linux, e.g. raspbian

- a USB memory stick or other additional storage should be mounted (maybe)

- you should be logged into root shell on the Pi which is running
  the linux image you want to distribute.

- make sure you have the zip and initramfs-tools packages installed:
```
apt-get install zip initramfs-tools
```
- grab the mkliwixi.sh script:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrzusto/liwixi/master/mkliwixi.sh
```
- run the script:
```bash
./mkliwixi BRAND DEST [TEMP]
```
  where:

    - BRAND: a string describing your linux distribution; whitespace
      is probably poisonous

    - DEST: path to a folder with enough room to store your compressed
      image plus boot files

    - TEMP: optional path to a folder with enough room to store your *uncompressed*
      image plus boot files; defaults to $DEST

After some chugging, you end up with a file called
`
$DEST/${BRAND}_LIWIXI.zip
`
Your end users can then unzip that file onto a fresh
micro SD card, and then boot a Pi directly from it.
